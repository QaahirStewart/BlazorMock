#### What Changed

**Updated Step Examples:**

- Step 2: Added Tailwind container layout and card styling to Home.razor example
- Step 3: Already included styled GreetingCard component with Tailwind classes
- Step 4: **Updated Counter.razor code block** to include full Tailwind styling matching the Live Demo (container, cards, styled buttons)
- Step 6: Added Tailwind navigation bar styling and responsive layout examples

**Documentation Updates:**

- `Docs/STYLE-GUIDE.md` ‚Äî Added "Example Code Formatting Preference" section requiring Tailwind classes in Razor examples
- `Docs/README.md` ‚Äî Updated Style Guide reference to mention Tailwind preference
- `Docs/AI-PROMPT-GUIDE.md` ‚Äî Added Tailwind preference note in UI component template

#### Rationale

Code examples should demonstrate production-ready patterns with proper styling, responsive design, and visual hierarchy rather than basic HTML elements. This helps learners understand how to build polished Blazor applications.

### üì± Responsive CRUD Pattern Implementation

Implemented a comprehensive responsive design pattern across all CRUD list pages to provide optimal user experience on all device sizes.

#### What Changed

**CRUD Pages Updated:**

- `Components/Pages/Drivers/DriverList.razor`
- `Components/Pages/Trucks/TruckList.razor`
- `Components/Pages/Routes/RouteList.razor`

**Pattern:**

- **Mobile (< 768px)**: Touch-friendly card layout using `md:hidden`
  - Cards show item details vertically with proper spacing
  - Large touch targets for Edit/Delete buttons
  - Clear visual hierarchy with font sizing and color
- **Desktop (‚â• 768px)**: Efficient table layout using `hidden md:block`
  - Scannable table with proper columns
  - Compact action buttons
  - Hover states for better UX

**Key Features:**

- Both layouts support inline editing for feature parity
- Breakpoint at md (768px) follows Tailwind conventions
- Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
- Consistent pattern across all CRUD pages

#### Documentation Updates

**Updated Files:**

- `Docs/Typography-System.md` ‚Äî Added "Responsive CRUD Pattern" section with code examples
- `Docs/STYLE-GUIDE.md` ‚Äî Added "Responsive CRUD List Pattern" to Component Patterns with complete examples
- `Docs/Steps/Step09.md` ‚Äî Added responsive layout examples with collapsible code blocks
- `Docs/BlazorLearningChecklist.md` ‚Äî Updated Step 9 checklist with responsive design items

**Code Example (Mobile):**

```razor
<div class="space-y-3 md:hidden">
    @foreach (var item in items)
    {
        <div class="rounded-2xl border border-gray-200 bg-white p-4">
            <!-- Item details -->
            <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-2">
                <button>Edit</button>
                <button>Delete</button>
            </div>
        </div>
    }
</div>
```

**Code Example (Desktop):**

```razor
<div class="overflow-x-auto hidden md:block">
    <table class="min-w-full border border-gray-200">
        <!-- Table headers and rows -->
    </table>
</div>
```

#### Build Verification

- Release build: Passed with no errors
- All CRUD pages tested on mobile and desktop breakpoints
- Inline editing works consistently across both layouts

**Impact:**

- Native mobile experience with touch-friendly cards
- Efficient desktop experience with scannable tables
- Consistent, learnable pattern across all CRUD operations
- Complete documentation for learners to reference and replicate

# Recent Updates & Improvements

## October 15, 2025 (Step 10 demo polish)

### üß© Live Demo Components + Copyable Code

- Step 10 Example (`Components/Pages/Examples/Step10Example.razor`)
  - Restored the Driver demo using two child components:
    - `Components/Pages/Examples/Step10/DriverPicker.razor`
    - `Components/Pages/Examples/Step10/SelectedDriverCard.razor`
  - Added collapsible "Show code" blocks with per-block Copy buttons (matching Step 13 pattern)
  - Wired copy handlers to use the existing JS module (`Step13Example.razor.js`)
  - Ensured `SelectedDriverCard.razor` unsubscribes from events by implementing `IDisposable`
- Build: Verified Release build passes

Impact: Learners can view and copy the exact demo component code in-place, with proper cleanup patterns showcased.

## October 15, 2025 (Step 11 UX polish)

### üß™ Assignment Validator: placeholders, reset, and bindings

- Guide (`Components/Pages/Guide.razor`, Step 11 card)
  - Added ‚Äú-- Select Route Type --‚Äù placeholder
  - Made route type selection nullable, updated change/reset handlers and validation to require a selection
  - Bound Route/Truck/Driver selects to state so Reset clears visible inputs
- Step 11 Example (`Components/Pages/Examples/Step11Example.razor`)
  - Live demo: same placeholder + nullable route type + state bindings + reset behavior
  - Updated code samples to reflect the placeholder and a simple null-check for route type before experience rules
  - Added concise bullet-point summaries above the Assignment Form and Validation Logic code blocks (matching Step 13 style)
- Build: Verified Release build passes

Impact: More intuitive demo UX‚ÄîReset now clears all inputs, and users are prompted to pick a route type before validation proceeds. Samples match the live behavior for consistency.

### üß† Step 10: State Management Demos

- Added a simple scoped AppState service (`Services/AppState.cs`) and registered it in `Program.cs`
- Guide (`Components/Pages/Guide.razor`, Step 10 card): Embedded a ‚ÄúShared Selection‚Äù inline demo using AppState
- Step 10 Example (`Components/Pages/Examples/Step10Example.razor`): Added a ‚ÄúLive Demo: Shared State (AppState)‚Äù section
- Both demos let you pick a driver and see mirrored details via shared state and event notifications

## October 14, 2025 (Build & EF housekeeping)

### ‚úÖ Build verified, EF packages aligned

- Verified Release build: passed with no errors
- Applied EF Core migrations to local SQLite DB (`blazormock.db`)
- On run, app started successfully on http://localhost:4001 (port 4000 was in use)
- Pinned EF Core package versions in `BlazorMock.csproj` to resolve NU1603 warnings:
  - Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore 9.0.0-rc.1.24451.1
  - Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite 9.0.0-rc.1.24451.1
  - Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design 9.0.0-rc.1.24451.1
- Note: `System.Drawing.Common` 4.7.0 reports a known vulnerability (NU1904). Not used directly by app UI; consider removing transitive source or upgrading if introduced later.

### Run tips

- Default profile binds to http://localhost:4000; if busy, use http://localhost:4001
- Development-only reset endpoint: POST http://localhost:4001/dev/reset-sample-data

## October 14, 2025 (Later)

### üß∞ Added Step 00 ‚Äî Prerequisites & VS Code Setup

- New doc: `Docs/Steps/Step00.md`
- Updated indexes and guides:
  - `Docs/README.md` ‚Äî inserted Step 00 at top of step list
  - `Docs/BlazorLearningGuide.md` ‚Äî added "Before You Start" section linking Step 00
  - `Docs/BlazorLearningChecklist.md` ‚Äî added Step 00 checklist items

Why: Learners starting from a blank machine can now set up .NET, Node.js, and VS Code confidently before Step 01.

### üóÑÔ∏è EF Core: Switch to Migrations and CRUD references

- Replaced `EnsureCreated()` with `db.Database.Migrate()` at startup in `Program.cs` (development-friendly)
- Documented migrations workflow in `Docs/Steps/Step08.md`
- Expanded CRUD guidance and linked in-app pages in `Docs/Steps/Step09.md`
- Updated in-app `Guide.razor` Step 8 and Step 9 cards:
  - Step 8 now shows quick CLI for `dotnet-ef` and mentions auto-apply migrations
  - Step 9 links directly to `/drivers`, `/trucks`, and `/routes` pages and calls out `Include()` usage

Impact: The app now follows a proper EF Core migrations workflow and learners can explore complete, styled CRUD examples.

### üå± Development Seed Data

- Added `Data/DevDataSeeder.cs` and invoked it in Development only (after migrations)
- Seeds sample Drivers, Trucks, and Routes for immediate CRUD exploration
- Guide (Step 9) notes that sample data appears automatically in Development

Impact: New learners can see populated lists without manual entry, making the demo more illustrative.

## October 14, 2025

### ‚ú® New: Blazor & C# Tips (existing categories)

### üß© Standardized In‚ÄëApp Code Samples (Show code + Copy) and Removed Page Toolbar

What changed:

- Established a standard pattern for in-app code samples that mirrors Step 13 and Step 4:
  - White card with heading, short description, and bullet points
  - Gray container wrapping a raw `<pre>` block
  - `data-code-title` attribute supplies the visible title
  - Site JS enhancer adds a per-block collapsible "Show code" summary and a Copy button automatically
- Permanently removed the global page-level "Expand/Collapse all code" toolbar from the enhancer script.

Rationale:

- Per-block controls are clearer and avoid UI clutter
- Keeps code samples contextual and scannable
- Simplifies the JS enhancer and reduces surprise UI on pages with many blocks

Docs updates:

- `Docs/STYLE-GUIDE.md`: Added "In‚ÄëApp Code Sample Pattern (Show code + Copy)" section with markup skeleton, Razor `@` escaping note, and policy to avoid global toolbars.

Verification:

- Step 4 example updated to match Step 13 visually and behaviorally
- Build: Release build passes with no errors

Impact:

- Consistent learner experience across steps
- No more page-level expand/collapse buttons; per-block control only
- Clear guidance documented for adding future samples
- **Breakpoints Used:** 4 (sm, md, lg, xl)
- **Lines of CSS Added:** ~60

## 2025-10-16

### üöö New: Trucking Schedule Demo (Finished Experience)

- Added `/demo/trucking-schedule`: a full end-to-end trucking schedule demo
  - KPIs: Scheduled (next 7 days), In Progress, Drivers/Trucks available
  - Filters: Text search, Status, Route Type
  - Grouped schedule by date with detailed rows (route, driver, truck, costs)
  - Actions: Start (sets In Progress, marks resources unavailable), Complete (sets Completed, marks resources available)
  - Links to manage routes at `/routes`
- Updated Guide quick links: card now points to the new demo
- Docs updates:
  - `BlazorLearningGuide.md`: Linked the demo under Step 13 section
  - `BlazorLearningChecklist.md`: Marked demo as available
  - `README.md`: Added demo to In-app routes

Build: Release build passed. Dev seeding provides sample data to explore immediately.

### üîß Fix: Demo reset dependencies

- Registered `IHttpClientFactory` in DI (`Program.cs`) to support the demo's "Reset Demo Data" action
- Adjusted reset call in `TruckingScheduleDemo.razor` to use the app's base URI for the POST to `/dev/reset-sample-data`
- Result: Eliminates 500s due to missing service and ensures the request targets the correct host/port
