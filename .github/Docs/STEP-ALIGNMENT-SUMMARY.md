## 🔧 Issue Found & Fixed

### Step 0 Navigation Inconsistency

**Problem:** Step 0 linked back to `/guide/demos` instead of `/guide`

**Fixed:** Updated both navigation links in `Step0Example.razor` to point to `/guide` and use text "Back to Guide" to match all other steps.

**Files Changed:**

- `Components/Pages/Examples/Step0Example.razor` (2 navigation links updated)

## 🎯 Common Pattern Verified

All pages follow this structure:

```razor
@page "/examples/step{N}"
@inject ILearningProgressService ProgressService
@inject NavigationManager Navigation
@rendermode InteractiveServer

<div class="min-h-screen py-8 rounded-4xl bg-gray-50">
    <div class="w-full mx-auto px-4 max-w-5xl">
        <!-- Back to Guide link -->
        <!-- Page header with title -->
        <!-- Learning objectives -->
        <!-- Code examples with syntax highlighting -->
        <!-- Pro tips and warnings -->
        <!-- Completion tracking section -->
    </div>
</div>

@code {
    private async Task MarkComplete()
    {
        await ProgressService.MarkStepCompleteAsync(stepNumber);
        // Update UI state
    }
}
```
