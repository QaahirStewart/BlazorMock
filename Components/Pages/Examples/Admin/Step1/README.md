# Admin Step 1 — Admin Layout Shell

This folder contains the files for **Admin Step 1**, where you build a one-page SaaS-style admin layout shell with a top navbar, sidebar, and main content area.

## Files

- `Example.razor` — Tutorial page that explains the goal of Step 1 and embeds the live demo.
- `Example.razor.cs` — Code-behind class `ExampleBase` that handles learning progress and code-block initialization.
- `AdminLayoutExample.razor` — Demo component that renders the admin layout shell with navbar, sidebar, and dashboard cards.
- `AdminLayoutExample.razor.cs` — Code-behind base class `AdminLayoutExampleBase` for the demo component.
- `README.md` — This documentation file.

## Routes

- Tutorial page: `/admin-examples/step1`
- Demo layout: `/admin-examples/demo-layout`

## Step Goal

By the end of this step you should have:

- A working admin layout shell that matches the visual character of the existing tutorials.
- A combined top navbar and sidebar that keeps everything on a single page.
- Clear markers for where Regular vs Admin-only content will go in later steps.
